# Data_Scientist_Capstone_Stock_Analysis
A project about stock data analysis for the last project of the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Data Scientist"

## Motivation
In order to personally feel more comfortable making trading decisions, I wanted to create a program, that quickly gathers, calculates, predicts and visualizes stock data for every stock at any time automatically on predefined criteria.

## Libraries used:
numpy, pandas, math, matplotlib, plotly, datetime, random, re, requests, time, yfinance, ta, pandas_ta, smtplib, json, tensorflow, keras, io, functools, chart_studio, email, sklearn, scipy, IPython, tqdm, alpha_vantage, statsmodels

## Repository Files:
1. stock_analysis_04.ipynb: Notebook including the complete code and description of the project.
2. stock_analysis_04.html: HTML Export of the latest notebook version.
3. api_keys: Folder that includes .txt-files with api-keys (censored on github)
4. data: Folder that holds all pictures, gifs, plotly plots, models, datasets and reports that are saved/loaded or used in the project.
5. web_app: Folder that holds so far only the front end of the future project web app.
